# TRAPPING

In this code we used all the previous steps to create a program, which simulate the trapping problem. 
In 2 dimensions box, with legth 500, we place a random concentration of molecule traps. 
The simulation start when we place a particle at a random position in the box and let it do a random walk. when the paricle stops it means that the particle was trapped. 
We save as a result the distribution of the trapping times, after 100000 simulations and also we use boundary conditions
